1. Credit card applications
Commercial banks receive a lot of applications for credit cards. Many of them get rejected for many reasons, like high loan balances, 
low income levels, or too many inquiries on an individual's credit report, for example.
Manually analyzing these applications is mundane, error-prone, and time-consuming (and time is money!). 
In this notebook, we will build an automatic credit card approval predictor using machine learning techniques.

We'll use the Credit Card Approval dataset from the UCI Machine Learning Repository.
